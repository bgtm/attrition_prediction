# IBM human resources data analysis : Predicting and understanding employee attrition

Employee attrition is a significant issue for companies. Indeed, human resources invest a lot to
recruit and train workers who become valuable assets for companies. Especially in our economic
context, more than 50% of French firms report having hiring difficulties (Banque de France).

Our work will focus on predicting if an employee will leave the company and understand why by establishing different profiles. We can make a small digression about ethics. These algo-
rithms can also be used to discriminate against some category of people. For instance, if a company realizes that until now, a certain type of people resign quickly, it can decide to stop recruiting them.

The purpose is to have parsimonious models with only variables that bring information to explain attrition.
